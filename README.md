Poker Game - Texas Hold'em
==========================

Made by: Ellis Simmons - Spring 2025  
Languages: JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML

What is this?
--------------
This is a basic Texas Hold'em Poker game built in React. Uses JS, CSS, and HTML too.
The idea was to build a simple card game with some AI opponents and get a feel for working with React and dynamic updates.

What it does:
--------------
- Deals you and two AIs two cards each.  
- Reveals the community cards (Flop, Turn, River).  
- Evaluates hands at the end to see who wins.  
- Uses real card images for a more authentic feel.

How it works:
--------------
- Uses React for UI updates and state management.  
- Basic poker hand evaluator to check for straights, flushes, etc.  
- Images loaded from the Deck of Cards API.  
- Buttons for dealing, revealing cards, and showdown.

Why I made it:
--------------
I wanted to build a simple card game to learn React and practice working with component state and mapping arrays to UI elements.  
Also wanted to build something fun to play against some AI logic.

Stuff you can change:
---------------------
- AI logic is currently random; could be improved with real poker logic. (WIll add it eventually, we shall see)    
- Change the number of players or community cards.  
- Use different images, tweak the CSS for a new look.  
- Could expand it into a multiplayer game if you wanted.
